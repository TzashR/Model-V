# Model-V
Learns and predicts values of data points in space by their neighbors, when their neighbors aren't always reliable
Files I'm actually working on are
  World_Objects - defining the classes for objects in the simulation: DataPoints, Map and Reporter
  
  WorldManager - defining the class of the Simulator Manager
  
  Simulator - Just the script where I run and play with the WorldManager
  
  Generic_Calcs - miscellaneous functions that I use (plotting distributions, calculating adjacency matrices etc)
  
  Optimization - Where I try to implement the functions relating the learning
  
  The other files aren't really relevant
